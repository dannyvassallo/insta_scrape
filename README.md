# InstaScrape

[NO LONGER MAINTAINED]

The instagram swiss army knife. Restores all deprecated hashtag functionality and grants public api access from instagram's front end without any of the authorization.

With `include_meta_data: true`, you can return a posts image, link, text, date, username, hi_res_image, and likes.
See the examples and usage pages for different methods and how to use them.

#### Note [ *PLEASE READ* ]

The number of results may vary when using certain methods as this *IS NOT* an official endpoint.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "insta_scrape"
```

For bleeding edge, install from the development branch:

```ruby
gem "insta_scrape", :git => "https://github.com/dannyvassallo/insta_scrape.git", :branch => "develop"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install insta_scrape

## How To Use

You'll probably want to use the [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) gem or something similar in order to create hashtag widgets like you once could. Scheduling a job (polling) and storing each post's information in your database/cache is one way to do it.


Standard Hashtag Scrape Example:
```ruby
#basic use case
scrape_result = InstaScrape.hashtag("test")
scrape_result.each do |post|
  puts post.image
  puts post.link
  puts post.text
end
```

Long Scrape a hashtag and get additional metadata:
```ruby
#you can set include_meta_data to false if
#you want to speed up the scrape
scrape_result = InstaScrape.long_scrape_hashtag('test', 1, include_meta_data: true)
scrape_result.each do |post|
  puts post.image
  puts post.link
  puts post.text
  puts post.date
  puts post.username
  puts post.hi_res_image
  puts post.likes
end
```
